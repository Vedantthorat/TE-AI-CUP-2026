## 📌 Project Overview  

This project builds an **AI-powered expert assistant** that analyzes machine data, detects early faults, and provides **expert-level reasoning** for high-speed progressive stamping dies.

The system works even **without real sensors**, using:
- synthetic sensor data  
- open industrial datasets  
- LLM + RAG reasoning  
- machine learning anomaly detection  

The solution focuses on:
- **Low cost**
- **Rapid deployment**
- **High accuracy**
- **Worker-friendly explanations**

## 🎯 Problem Statement  

Modern stamping die machines generate large amounts of performance and sensor data, but:
- Skilled engineers are limited  
- New workers struggle with machine failures  
- Wrong decisions lead to downtime  
- Existing tools are expensive  

The TE AI Cup challenges us to build an **AI solution that reasons like an expert**, detects faults, explains causes, and suggests corrective actions in real time.
